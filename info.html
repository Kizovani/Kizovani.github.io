                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Hello! My name is <span class="highlight">Petar</span>, otherwise known online as <span class="highlight">Kizovani</span>. Welcome to my website!</p>
                    <p>I built this website to showcase things I learn about web development and to have some fun building something that I thought looked cool.</p>
                </section>
        
                <section class="section">
                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>I was a freelance video editor over the Covid Quarantine and had a lot of fun being able to express things the way I thought looked the be   st. It was just a matter of knowing how to use the tools I was given to be able to do whatever I wanted (and what the client asked for, of course). I loved the feeling of endless possibilities as long as I could figure out how to use the tools I had properly.</p>
                    <p>I got that same feeling after being given a default website boilerplate in one of my classes in university, and I wanted to see what I could do to satisfy the itch of the image I had in my head of what I could create. This website is what came out the other end.</p>
                </section>
        
                <section class="section">
                    <h2>About the Site</h2>
                    <p>Each page is a little different, so I will get into as much detail as I can about each one.</p>
                    <h3>Title page:</h3>
                    <p>The main/landing page was built mostly using three.js for the main scene, with the model being <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/angel-17d22525b4124088a8827d9c45a2627f">just8's "Angel"</a> model lifted from sketchfab, since I really liked the way it looked. Unfortunately, I had to heavily reduce the original quality of the model (from about one million polygons to about 1 percent of that). Then I used the ASCII effect in three.js to add a personal touch to it. Which also allowed for the model quality to be so low and load quicker since the effect drops the detail anyway. </p>
                    <p>I found the animation on its own to be a little too boring, so I added the light controls to add some more fun to it. The actual aninimation of the controls menu (the range slider and on/off switch) in and out of the view is done with GSAP, which I heard about before starting this project, so I wanted to try it out for myself.</p>
                    <p>Up next was the menu bar. I wanted to make this look unique yet still fit the theme, and lo and behold, the great Google algorithm saw I was interested in HTML, CSS, and the 'menu bar' keyword, so it decided to recommend me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc5fU2_8EE4&t=245s">this</a> video from codegrid, a Youtube channel I had never seen or heard of before. So I incorporated much of his work with some small tweaks to make it fit the theme better. I noticed he was also using GSAP, which was a happy accident and helped me learn a lot more about some use cases for it.</p>
                    <h3>Projects Page</h3>
                    <p>Then came my Projects page, I wasnt sure how I wanted this to look to be honest, but I knew I wanted it to obviously showcase some of the other fun projects I've done and some of the things I've learned along the way.</p>
                    <p>I ended up making those kind of cards you see, they were pretty simple, and done entirely in css although I cant remember the tutorial I followed, otherwise I would have also linked it here</p>
                    <p>Then of course comes the backround monster/worm/centipede thing in the backround, I was actually on instagram when a friend sent me this [INSERT LINK HERE] post, with the caption "you should put this on your website" so thats exactly what I did, apart from changing some starting conditions that code is entirely unaltered and full credits go to [INSERT NAME AND LINK HERE]</p>
                    <h3>Info Page</h3>
                    <p>And then we finally arrive to this very info page, which even though its a bunch of text, was actually alot harder to get working the way I wanted with the baffle.js library (the library that scrambles/animates) the text, for some reason, the baffle effect completely removes links in the text, no clue why, I ended up having to read this entire info page, store it, and then repaste it over the effect when it completes, annoying, but sometimes you have to just make do.</p>

                    <h2>Easter Eggs</h2>
                    <p class="note">There are some smaller jokes I have also built into the site. Try and find them yourself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>they are all on the main page</li>
                        <li>one has to do with hanging around for far too long</li>
                        <li>One is to do with playing too roughly with the avatar (this is a complete lie and not implemented yet)</li>
                        <li>The other has to do with the special cheat code of a certain video game company starting with a 'K' (another lie and not implemented yet)</li>
                        <li>There is also a way to reveal all of the "secrets" of the site on this page if you can guess and type out my favorite word (final lie I swear)</li>
                    </ul>
